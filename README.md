# 🏆 Tournament Management System - Microservices Architecture

## 📖 Project Overview

This project is a robust, scalable **Tournament Management Platform** built using a **Microservices Architecture**. It is designed to handle complex tournament logic, automatic matchmaking, and real-time score processing.

The system is fully containerized using **Docker**, separating the Frontend (SPA) from the Backend logic, while allowing seamless interaction via a unified **Docker Compose** network.

## 🏗 Architecture

The solution relies on a decoupled architecture where the Frontend acts as a consumer of the RESTful APIs provided by the Backend services.

### Components Breakdown:

1. **Frontend (Angular Client):**
* A Single Page Application (SPA) built with **Angular 17+**.
* Served via **Nginx** (Alpine) for high-performance static content delivery.
* Uses **RxJS** for reactive state management and HTTP communication.
* Implements a **Reverse Proxy** strategy via Nginx to handle routing and API forwarding.


2. **Backend (Java Microservices):**
* **Tournament Core:** Handles the CRUD operations for tournaments, participants, and general data persistence.
* **Oracle Engine:** A specialized service containing the complex algorithms for matchmaking, score calculation, and rule validation.
* Built with **Java 21 (LTS)** and **Spring Boot 3**.


3. **Infrastructure:**
* **Docker:** Used for containerizing all services using Multi-stage builds.
* **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates the startup, networking, and volume management of the entire ecosystem.



## 🛠 Technology Stack

### 🔵 Backend

* **Language:** Java 21 (Eclipse Temurin / OpenJDK)
* **Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x
* **Build Tool:** Maven 3.9
* **Database:** (H2/MySQL/PostgreSQL - *configured in application.properties*)

### 🟢 Frontend

* **Framework:** Angular 17+
* **Language:** TypeScript 5.x
* **Server:** Nginx 1.25 (Alpine Linux)
* **Node.js:** v20/v22 (for build process)

### 🐳 DevOps & Containerization

* **Multi-Stage Docker Builds:** To ensure minimal image sizes.
* **Alpine Linux:** Base OS for production containers to reduce attack surface.
* **Internal Networking:** Bridge network (`app-network`) for secure service-to-service communication.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop** (or Docker Engine + Compose plugin) installed.
* Git (to clone the repository).
* No local Java or Node.js installation is required (Docker handles the runtime).

### Installation & Execution

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmontelongo/score-predictor.git
cd score-predictor

```


2. **Run the Project (The "Magic" Command):**
This single command will build the Java JARs, compile the Angular application, and start the Nginx server and Backend services.
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d

```


3. **Access the Application:**
* **Frontend UI:** [http://localhost](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost) (Served on Port 80)
* **Backend API:** [http://localhost:8080](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8080) (or the configured port)


4. **Stopping the Services:**
```bash
docker-compose down

```



## ⚙️ Configuration Details

### Docker Configuration

We use a **Multi-Stage Build** strategy to optimize performance and storage:

* **Backend Dockerfile:**
1. *Build Stage:* Uses `maven:3.9-eclipse-temurin-21`. Downloads dependencies and packages the JAR.
2. *Run Stage:* Uses `eclipse-temurin:21-jre-alpine`. Copies only the artifact `app.jar`.


* **Frontend Dockerfile:**
1. *Build Stage:* Uses `node:22-alpine`. Installs npm packages and runs `ng build`.
2. *Run Stage:* Uses `nginx:1.25-alpine`. Copies the `/dist/browser` folder to Nginx's html root.



### Nginx & Routing

The Frontend container includes a custom `nginx.conf` to handle:

* **SPA Routing:** Redirects 404 errors to `index.html` so Angular handles the routes.
* **Reverse Proxy (Optional):** Can be configured to forward `/api` requests directly to the Java container name (e.g., `http://tournament-core:8080`).

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

* **Error: "403 Forbidden" on Frontend:**
* *Cause:* Nginx cannot find the `index.html` in the root folder.
* *Fix:* Ensure the Dockerfile `COPY` command points to the specific `/browser` subfolder generated by Angular 17+ builds.


* **Error: "Connection Refused" (Frontend to Backend):**
* *Cause:* The browser is trying to access the backend via the Docker container name.
* *Fix:* Use `http://localhost:8080` in your Angular environment files, or configure the Nginx Reverse Proxy.


* **Error: "Maven/Java Version Mismatch":**
* *Fix:* The `Dockerfile` is explicitly set to use JDK 21. Ensure your IDE matches this version if developing locally without Docker.

## 💡 Project Background & AI Collaboration

This project was developed as a personal **hobby and portfolio initiative**. The primary goal is to demonstrate the end-to-end implementation of a **Microservices Architecture** integrated with a modern **Frontend**, showcasing skills in full-stack development and container orchestration.

**🤖 AI-Assisted Development:**
This project utilizes **Google Gemini 3 pro** as a strategic development partner. The AI was instrumental in:

* Generating and optimizing **Docker** and **Docker Compose** scripts.
* Validating configuration files (Nginx, Maven, NPM).
* Accelerating error diagnosis and troubleshooting during the integration phase.
